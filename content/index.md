mdms intends to keep it simple, mdms doesn't use a database. period. The use of flat file data storage techniques allow for content to be created, deleted, and edited quickly and easily. mdms shouldn't stop you from creating, it should help do it, simpler.

mdms is free and open source, every single piece of it. Do what you want with it, it won't cost you a penny.
