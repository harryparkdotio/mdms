## About the Creator
Harry Park is a developer from down under (Sydney, Australia) with a passion for creating awesome projects that both do and don't make a whole lot of sense. mdms is one of those few projects that actually does have a reason behind it.

## Why I built mdms
I built mdms mainly because I wanted a truly simple, and easily customizeable cms with no database. So that's exactly what I set out to do, and I did it, I built mdms.

## Reasoning behind the madness
Now it's not something which is usually recommended, I mean there are already many fantastic platforms. I didn't really fancy learning another platform, only to discover it can't do exactly what I want it to do. That's why I built mdms, because I built it, I know it inside and out, making it easier for me to develop for and upon.

## Stupidity & Sensibility
Content management systems are truly nudge the boundries of both sensibility and stupidity. Not going with a standard database cms variant is slightly stupid, as well as being somewhat sensible, reason being, they can't be attacked using SQL injection, or other database related attacking methods and strategies. However, as soon as you remove the database, you realize, (and know from the beginning) that storing content in files directly is your only sensible option, and that's exactly what I did, I'm storing all content directly in .md markdown files.

## How easy is mdms to develop for?
If you ask me, I'd say extremely simple, then again that is likely a biased opinion, I mean I built the thing. More seriously, I do actually believe that mdms is really easy to develop for, while not the original intention of mdms, it quickly became apparent, and so, I tried to keep everything as simple as could be without comprimise. All of that results in a simple platform that has surprising amount of functionality.

## Can I see an example?
You sure can! Your looking at an one right now!
